A microcontroller and FPGA based, modular prototyping solution covering both hardware and software.

This project was started by Sioux Embedded Systems BV employees in their private time.

The aim of this project is to broaden experience and not only in your own discipline. Members are encouraged to both explore beyond their own discipline(s) and provide guidance to other members were they can. Learning & sharing is what we do. In line of this mindset, everything developed within the project will be made available under terms of a permissive (MIT) license.
