A microcontroller and FPGA based, modular prototyping solution covering both hardware and software.

This project was started by Sioux Embedded Systems BV employees in their private time.

The aim of this project is to broaden experience and not only in your own discipline. Members are encouraged to both explore beyond their own discipline(s) and provide guidance to other members were they can. Learning & sharing is what we do. In line of this mindset, everything developed within the project will be made available under terms of a permissive (MIT) license.

Some trivia: 
* [Cynara](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cynara) is a genus in the sunflower family.
* Addon modules for the Carrier are called Petals.

## Ideas & Goals

#### Target audience

Our target audience is everyone up from the semi-professional hobbyist.

#### Tooling

Goals:
* Keep it simple.
* Keep the complete set of mandatory tooling to a minimum.
* Keep tooling cheap, preferably free.
* Don't reinvent the wheel.

#### Carrier

The Carrier is a complete package of software, HDL, hardware, documentation and partial configuration.

#### Petal

A Petal is a complete package of software, HDL, hardware, documentation and partial configuration.

Goals:
* Keep it simple.
* Keep it cheap.
* Provide a Petal template for jumpstarting.

#### Configuration

Goals:
* Configuration needs to be very intuitive.
* The configuration should understand the restrictions of the microcontroller, FPGA, Carrier and Petal(s).
* A configuration should be validated even before compile-time. Validation during actual designing/writing of the configuration would be nice.
